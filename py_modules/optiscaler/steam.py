    Two kinds of entry, and only one of them has an app manifest. A Steam game
    is found the usual way. A **non-Steam shortcut** has no manifest, no
    ``steamapps/common`` folder and no install directory anywhere in Steam's
    records — the client knows what to run and nothing else — so its folder is
    derived from that target instead. Heroic launch URIs are resolved through
    its installed-game records; a launcher executable is never a game folder.

    ``exe``/``start_dir``/``name`` are what the client said, passed down by the
    frontend when it could read them. They are tried before ``shortcuts.vdf`` for the
    reason the launch-options read tries the client first: the file is flushed
    on Steam's schedule and a shortcut added this session may not be in it yet.

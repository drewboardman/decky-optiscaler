A [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) plugin that installs and
configures [OptiScaler](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler) per game from Game Mode
(SteamOS, Bazzite, whatever you run). Frame generation, upscaler overrides and the rest of
OptiScaler's settings, with a gamepad. The ones OptiScaler can change on the fly apply to the
running game; the rest say plainly that they take effect on the next launch.

OptiScaler v0.9.4 is bundled, so installing works offline and every game gets the same build.

## What it does

- **Finds your games and the folder to install into.** Steam libraries from
  `libraryfolders.vdf` including the SD card, non-Steam shortcuts, and any folder you add as a
  custom library. OptiScaler has to sit next to the executable that creates the D3D device, so
  the plugin scores the candidates (Unreal's `Binaries/Win64`, Cyberpunk's `bin/x64`) and lets
  you override its pick.
- **Finds Heroic games automatically.** Epic, GOG and Amazon Windows games in native and
  Flatpak Heroic installations appear in the library. Heroic's Steam shortcuts resolve to
  the real game folder, using the same executable picker as Steam games.
- **Sets the game up from the wiki, online or not.** Your game is matched against the OptiScaler
  [Compatibility List](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/wiki/Compatibility-List), with a
  search box to pin the right entry. A copy of the list ships with the plugin and the last
  download is cached, so answers come from disk at once and the refresh runs behind them. Setup
  is then a checklist — install the DLL under the filename the entry names, write the launch
  options, apply the settings it lists — and every line says which wiki field it came from
  before anything is written. Anything the plugin couldn't place is shown to you rather than
  guessed at, including the games that need
  [REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework) installed first.
- **Basic or Advanced settings.** Basic is a handful of controls (frame generation on/off, which
  generator, 2X/3X/4X, which upscaler), each driving several INI keys at once. Advanced gives
  you all 288 settings across 34 sections, generated from the comments in `OptiScaler.ini` so
  they match the shipped build. Edits keep every comment in the file, and names are the
  overlay's own.
- **FSR 4.1.1b on Steam Deck.** Close the game, then choose **FSR 4.1.1b — Steam Deck**
  in Basic settings. One selection downloads the community RDNA2 ghosting fix and enables
  INT8 upscaling. Frame generation stays separate. See [Steam Deck FSR 4](docs/steam-deck-fsr4.md)
  for verification, rollback, and limitations.
- **Changes settings while you play.** A bundled ASI plugin applies frame generation, the
  FidelityFX FG version, the upscaler and the FSR version immediately from the Quick Access
  panel — next to what the game actually ended up running and, with frame generation on, both
  frame rates. See [Live in-game control](#live-in-game-control).
- **Doesn't lose your files, or your launch options.** Anything an install would overwrite is
  moved into `decky_optiscaler_backup_files/` and put back on uninstall. The launch options the
  game had beforehand are kept the same way, so removing OptiScaler can offer to restore them
  rather than clearing a field it never owned.
- **Odds and ends.** `OptiScaler.log` is parsed for the backend that got created, the GPU and
  the Proton version. [OptiPatcher](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiPatcher) is bundled. An
  **OptiScaler Settings** entry is added to the game's Steam library context menu.

## Installing

Grab `Decky-OptiScaler-v*.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/danielcamilo1/decky-optiscaler/releases/latest), then either:

- In Game Mode, open Decky's settings, turn on **Developer mode**, and use
  **Install Plugin from URL** with the zip's download link; or
- unpack the zip into `~/homebrew/plugins/` and restart Decky Loader.

Every release bundles OptiScaler itself, so there is nothing else to download.
See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed.

## Heroic Games Launcher

Native (`~/.config/heroic`) and Flatpak
(`~/.var/app/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl/config/heroic`) installations are detected
without a toggle. Install OptiScaler as usual; **Manual setup → Install location**
selects the executable folder if the automatic pick needs changing.

Then quit the game and Heroic completely, including its tray icon, and choose
**Enable DLLs in Heroic** in the game's Setup tab. This merges the required Wine DLL
overrides into Heroic's per-game settings, including `dinput8` when REFramework is
installed. Launch through Heroic or its existing Steam shortcut. The plugin leaves
the shortcut's command and launch arguments intact.

The plugin records the previous overrides. **Restore previous Heroic overrides**
undoes the change, and removing OptiScaler through Setup restores them first.
Unrelated settings are preserved. If you edit the same DLL override in Heroic after
setup, the plugin reports the conflict instead of overwriting it. Heroic must be
closed during settings changes because it caches its configuration.

The Heroic action configures DLL loading only. Apply any additional game arguments
listed by the compatibility checklist in Heroic yourself. Custom Heroic config
locations and unsupported launcher formats can still use a custom library and
manual per-game environment settings. Native Linux games are excluded. Discovery
and settings changes are covered by fixtures; a real Steam Deck/Flatpak launch and
live-control check are still required to validate the complete runtime path.

## Live in-game control

OptiScaler reads its INI once, at startup — no file watcher, no IPC — and its overlay gets away
with live changes only because it *is* the game process. So the plugin ships a small ASI plugin
that OptiScaler loads into the game and that makes the same writes the overlay makes. That is
what lets the Quick Access panel change, mid-game:

- **Frame generation** — `Config::FGEnabled`, read every frame.
- **Upscaler** — the backend id into `State::newBackend`, then every entry of
  `State::changeBackend` marked. The overlay's "Change Upscaler" in full.
- **FidelityFX FG version** — `Config::FfxFGIndex`, then `State::FGchanged` and
  `State::SCchanged`, so the generator's context is destroyed and rebuilt on the new index. The
  versions offered are the ones the SDK reported to *that* game.
- **FSR version** — `Config::FfxUpscalerIndex` plus the same feature rebuild. One backend id
  covers every FSR from 2.3.4 to 4.1.1, so the exact version comes from the list the running
  game reported — the same one its overlay names in the title bar.

It also reads out both frame rates: what the game renders next to what reaches the screen, and
says when the generator is switched on but not actually inserting frames.

## Steam launch options

Proton loads its own `dxgi.dll` unless you tell it not to, so the proxy needs an override:

```
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dxgi=n,b" %command%
```

Setup shows the exact string for the filename you picked and can write it for you.
`OptiScaler.asi` installs don't need it.

Whatever Steam was passing beforehand is recorded next to the install, so removing OptiScaler
asks what to do with the field: restore exactly what was there, remove only the OptiScaler
override, or leave it alone. The answer can be remembered; **Settings** on the main page lists
remembered answers and takes them back.

## Requirements

- Decky Loader
- One of `7z`, `7zz`, `7za`, `7zr` or `bsdtar` to unpack the bundled release. SteamOS has both
  p7zip and bsdtar. It runs once, on first install.

## Building

```sh
pnpm install
python3 scripts/generate_schema.py   # option metadata, from the reference INI
python3 scripts/fetch_compat_seed.py # refresh the bundled compatibility list
./asi/build.sh                       # live-control ASI -> bin/ (needs zig)
pnpm build
python3 scripts/package.py           # -> out/Decky OptiScaler.zip
```

`asi/build.sh` cross-compiles a Windows x64 DLL with `zig cc`, so you don't need MSVC or a
Windows machine; `brew install zig` is the only prerequisite. Packaging without the ASI works
fine, live control just reports itself as unavailable.

Tests:

```sh
python3 scripts/selftest.py                          # backend, against a synthetic library
HARNESS=run.tsx node testharness/build-and-run.mjs    # renders the UI headlessly
HARNESS=all-options.tsx node testharness/build-and-run.mjs
```

## Support

This plugin is free and open source, and it will stay that way. If it got a game running better
on your Deck and you feel like saying thanks, you can buy me a coffee — it is genuinely
appreciated and it keeps the updates coming ☕

## AI disclosure

This plugin was built with heavy use of AI: Claude Opus 5 was the model mainly used for its development. Every design decision, review and manual testing runs were mine, and everything here has been run on an Xbox Ally X running Bazzite.

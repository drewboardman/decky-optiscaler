/**
 * Setting a game up, as a checklist rather than a page of panels.
 *
 * Three things have to happen for OptiScaler to work: the DLL goes next to the
 * game's executable, Steam has to be told to load it instead of Proton's own,
 * and the settings the wiki names for this game have to reach the ini. The old
 * Setup tab had all three, spread over nine sections and a mode switch, and
 * nothing said what had been done. This says all three before they happen and
 * keeps saying them afterwards, which is the same list read twice.
 *
 * Only the first is compulsory: the launch options and the wiki's settings each
 * carry a toggle, before the install as a choice and after it as the way to
 * undo that step alone. Everything else — the file name, the folder,
 * OptiPatcher, FSR 4 files, picking a different wiki entry — is behind "Manual
 * setup", because it is a minority of set-ups and all of it has a default that
 * works.
